<!-- The Document Object Model is a programming interface provided by browsers that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. Each HTML element on a web page is represented as an object in the DOM. JavaScript can interact with these objects to dynamically modify the content, structure, and style of a web page. -->

<!-- The Box Object Model is a concept that represents how elements are laid out on a web page. Each HTML element is treated as a box, and the BOM defines properties such as width, height, padding, margin, and border for these boxes. -->
